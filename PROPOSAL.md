# Motivation and Purpose

Our role: A data scientist consultancy firm.

Target audience: People who are interested in the used car market and want to compare and learn about the performance and prices of different models and energy sources.

The used car market is a rapidly growing industry where consumers have access to a wide range of vehicles with different models, features, and energy sources. The motivation behind this project is to help people better understand the performance and prices of different used cars and visualize how they compare to one another. By providing data visualizations, we aim to empower consumers to make more informed decisions when purchasing a used car.

On the other hand, we can also honor and learn about the history of the used car market by visualizing the performances of iconic car models from previous decades. For instance, we can learn about the glory of the classic muscle cars and how they performed compared to modern electric vehicles. Salute to the timeless American muscle cars.

# Description of the data

The used car market data for this application will be retrieved from various sources including private dealerships, online marketplaces, and car auctions. The data will include information on different used car models, their energy sources, performance metrics, and prices.

The data features that will be used for this application are as follows:

1. The car model name; `Model`

2. The year of the car; `Year`

3. The energy size of the car; `Energy Size`

4. Performance metrics of the car
 - `Horsepower`
 - `Acceleration`


5. Price metrics of the car
 - `Price`


# Primary research question and usage scenarios

The project aims to answer the following primary question:

`How do different used car models compare in terms of performance and price?`

`What are the best energy sources for used cars in terms of fuel efficiency and overall performance?`

`How have the performance and prices of used cars changed over time?`

Below is an example of a usage scenario from a member of our target audience.

John is in the market for a used car and wants to make an informed decision on which car to buy. He has a general idea of the type of car he wants but is not sure about the specific model or energy source. By using the `Used Car Comparison` visualization, John can input his desired car features, such as `SUV` and `hybrid`, and compare the performance and prices of different models. He can filter the results by performance metrics, such as `Fuel Efficiency` and `Acceleration`, and price metrics, such as `List Price` and `Mileage`. This will help John make a more informed decision when purchasing a used car that meets his needs and preferences.
